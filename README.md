# In_The_Loop
In The Loop is an application that will allow users to stay in sync at all times using lists. These lists will act as a hub for multiple users to keep up on a list in real time. Any user that is a part of a list items to the list. Items that are created by a user can also be edited or deleted by the user who posted the items or the Admin / creator of the list itself. In The Loop will take the tediousness out of keeping individual lists to work towards a group goal. This app will allow the same synchronized list to be stored on multiple users accounts. Got a family camping trip coming up next month? That's okay, add all the adults to the list and start listing the items to get this camping trip going. Work opposite schedules as your other half? Never go to the store at the same time but always find yourself calling to check if you need anything from the store? Just throw that list In The Loop and never have to call again. If you see that you need more bread while you run to the store just simple check it off and it will be removed from both lists! Happy shopping!
